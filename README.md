# SMU PCMob3-1: App #1 - Kueh Lapis/Colour List, Part 1

Welcome to **App #1 - Kueh Lapis/Colour List, Part 1**, part of the SMU PCMob3-1 project. This app demonstrates how to generate and display a list of random colors and navigate between views in a React Native application.

## App Overview

- **Generate Random Colour**: A button that, when clicked, generates a random color square.
- **Scrollable Colour List**: Displays a scrollable list of randomly generated colors using `FlatList`.
- **View Color Details**: When a color is clicked, it navigates to a new view in the Stack to show details about the color.

## Features

- **Random Colour Generation**: Click the button to generate a random color square.
- **FlatList for Color Display**: Utilize `FlatList` to create a scrollable list of colors.
- **Navigation**: Implement navigation to show details of the selected color in a new view.
